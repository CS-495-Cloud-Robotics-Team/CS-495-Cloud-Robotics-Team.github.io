## Project Goals

PuppyPi is an AI vision quadruped robot that has capabilities including autonomous mapping, navigation and path planning, the capability to play many different games, gait changes and more.

Our project will provide a client-server architecture to develop educational systems to support STEM interest in K-12 students. We intend to expand the PuppyPi's capabilities to respond to voice commands using AWS and a LLM.
